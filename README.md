# dirsToHtml
v0.65b@20022021

This program attempts to do the following:
Traverses a directory structure on the disk and create a html document (index.html) linking to the files found inside these folders.

The general idea is to offer an convenient way to browse the directory/files

Some command line arguments (not yet exahaustive):
-d [directory] : directory to start traversing

-o [output file]: file to write html into

-c : color cycling (random) of directory names at each level

...and some others. Sorry, no time to fully complete the list.
